Business understands that the sole obligation of GOLD is to execute the referenced marketing campaign as described in this insertion order.</span>

Business agrees to pay in advance for any business events and there will be no chargebacks allowed once the campaign is set up, and once the G-Coin promotions and rewards have been spent, then there is no chargeback. Business knows and agrees, based upon the ad offer, if business is unable to provide conversion information, or intentionally deletes the tracking pixels; and/or GOLD’s tracking system fails to report Actions or reports less Actions than the actual amount, then business agrees to pay GOLD based on an estimate to be negotiated in good faith by the parties based on the data available to both parties.

                    <span class="privacy_title_md">Reporting will be based on the number of Actions as shown by GOLD’s own tracking methods, typically a pixel placed on Business’s site.  Business understands there may be a discrepancy from time to time between their reporting system and GOLD. In such a case, GOLD agrees to provide detailed information on each discrepancy Action if such information exists, and Business agrees to pay for any Actions that contain sufficient information to qualify said Action as legitimate. In the event that Business and GOLD encounter any discrepancies, both parties agree to work diligently to resolve such items, and also agree to work together to address any technical issues so as to eliminate discrepancies in the future.  GOLD may accept changes material to campaign specific details only by accepting such terms in writing. FOR ALL LEAD GENERATION CAMPAIGNS: A “valid lead'' depends upon both the post back information on GOLD, and once the prospect is contacted by Business, the prospect is interested in the service or product, this may be a valid lead. “Conversion rate” is based upon actual sales made by those prospects. In the event that the Lead does not result in a conversion sale, then both parties (Business and GS) can provide their comments in their reviews - GOLD will maintain and display all relevant comments.  GOLD also reminds both parties to remember the importance of their online reputation.  In this way, all parties involved are promoting good marketing skills and business brand reputations.</span>
