            <p class="privacy_title_md">The following the terms of use constitute a legal agreement between you, the visitor of the Golden Link Plus website, and Gold, the service owner (“Gold”, “We, “Us”, “GS”, GS marketers or “Gold Striker'') and governs your use of the Gold Service (the “Service”). Please read this Agreement carefully before using or registering for the Service. For the purpose of this Agreement, by using and registering for the Service, you agree to the terms and conditions of this agreement. IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE OR REGISTER FOR THE SERVICE. YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE TERMS FREQUENTLY AS Gold MAY CHANGE THIS AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME BY POSTING A REVISED VERSION. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT INCLUDING UPDATED VERSIONS. All GS members must agree with GoldenLink+ policies and maintain their marketing campaign in good standing, not violate the GOLD rules, not to run malicious traffic, not to solicit fake clicks. If all these conditions are met, members can maintain their membership and continue to increase their revenue and sell or transfer their accounts upon the Platform's approval. To assist with the platform growth in a proper direction and avoiding unfair or illegal activities or events on GOLD, GOLD will maintain records of all activities and comments regardless if good or poor, this includes: stars, reviews, followers, amount of Diamonds and G-Coins reward, as well as conversion rates for businesses and GS marketers. </p>
            <p class="privacy_title_md">Regarding fake traffic, it will be considered as fake traffic or violations in the following situations:<br>
              <ul class="guideline_ul">
                <li>CPL (Cost Per Leads), where the conversion rate of the leads is below industry norms.</li>
                <li>CPI (Cost Per Installation), where the person downloads, then deletes the download immediately.</li>
                <li>CPC (Cost Per Click), where the GS uses machine generated or purchases fake clicks in order to make income.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="privacy_title_md">In the above scenarios, these would be considered as “fake traffic”, affecting both the GS’s reputation and relationship with the Business campaign.</p>
            <p class="privacy_title_md"><b>Valid CPC Example (Cost Per Clicks)</b><br>Question: After I share the link, can I invite friends in the community to click on the link I shared? Answer: Yes, you can invite anyone in the community to click; however, you will only gain a commission if that person also buys (conversion), if that person ONLY clicks, it’s not rewarded, that person must also purchase.</p>
